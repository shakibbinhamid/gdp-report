\subsection{Feature Definition as Requirements}
\label{subsec:feautre-definition-as-requirements}

Feature files can be seen as an entry point to cucumber test cases \cite{featurefile1}. Each of the feature file should be written to test a single feature of the application or a particular area of feature \cite{featurefile2}. Since we were writing E2E tests for the payment feature, we created \texttt{buycredits.feature} file for testing this aspect. Consider \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}}:\\

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=\parindent, linenos, breaklines, breakanywhere, bgcolor=lightgray, fontsize=\small]{cucumber}
@dev @experiment
Feature: Buying Credit feature
  As a user of Synote
  I should be able to successfully buy credits when logged in

  Scenario: Access buy credits page when logged in
    Given I click the "Profile" button on "SideMenu" page
    Given I click the "BuyCredit" button on "Profile" page
    Then I should be on "BuyCredits" page

  Scenario: Buy credit with empty card number
    Given I click the "Profile" button on "SideMenu" page
    Given I click the "BuyCredit" button on "Profile" page
    Given I Correctly type in my details but "" for "number"
    Then Submit button should be disabled
//code omitted
\end{minted}

\label{lst:buycredits-feature-file}
\end{listing}

The section in \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}} is written in a language called \texttt{Gherkin}. \texttt{Gherkin} makes use of Business Readable Domain Specific Language (BRDSL) which allows us to write the test cases at a business level without getting into implementation details. Hence, they serve as both documentation and actual automation test scripts \cite{featurefile1}.\\

Each of the feature file should be defined with \texttt{Feature} keyword which consists of a name  (see \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}} line  2) and brief description  (see \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}} line  3-4). Each of the test cases are defined with \texttt{Scenario} keyword followed by a brief description of that test (see \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}} line  6 and 11). Each scenario should \cite{featurefile3}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe event taking place
\item Describe expected result
\end{itemize}

We use \texttt{Steps} to achieved this. Consider the \texttt{Access buy credits page when logged in scenario} in \textbf{Listing \ref{lst:buycredits-feature-file}}. We use keywords such as \texttt{Given} (line 7 and 8), \texttt{Then} (line 9) for writing readable test cases. Consider \textbf{Table \ref{tab:steps-keywords}} which define \texttt{Step} keywords \cite{featurefile1}
