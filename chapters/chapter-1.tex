Our client Synote has created a web application to create automated transcripts for uploaded videos (e.g. lecture videos). The product, also called Synote, originated as a research project at the university and is now being prepared for a much larger audience - general public. Our project goals can be divided into three major categories.

Firstly, Synote lacked a mission critical feature - a payment system for its customers. At the same time, Synote had no End to End (E2E) tests, in fact, no Synote developer succeeded in previous similar efforts. So, our porject initially began with creating a custom E2E testing framework and payment system for Synote and demonstrating our framework by writing E2E tests for the payment system.\\

However, our project scope had since exapanded considerably because of our rapid delivery and meeting the original goals. In addition to the E2E testing framework, the payment system implementation and E2E tests, we introduced a methodology for code coverage and achieved nearly 100\% server side unit and integration test coverage for the payment system, making it secure and robust.\\

Finally, Synote required a Continuous Integration (CI) process. In fact, Synote had no prior experience in this endeavour. We delivered Synote's first CI process by completely automating the experiment deployment.
